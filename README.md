## How to install

To install this Docker image as DNS cache, you can execute the following steps:

- Make sure you have Docker installed.
- Donwload the [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TomTonic/coredns-fanout/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml) and the [Corefile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TomTonic/coredns-fanout/refs/heads/main/Corefile) from above and put them next to each other in a directory on the local server machine.
- Make sure the architecture in the `image: tomtonic/coredns-fanout:latest-amd64` directive in the docker-compose.yml file matches your local server's CPU.
- Start with `docker compose up` and test via `dig github.com @127.0.0.1` from a second console.
- Configure both files to your (network's) needs. Especially, set the bind addresses in the Corefile to the public interface of your local server.
- Don't forget to configure your clients to use the new server, advertize it via DHCP, for example.
